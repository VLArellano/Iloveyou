                        <p>
                            This is kinda sweet, but I know that I'm crazy in love with you when I do the things that I didn't expect to do; all of that is worth it because every bit of it is for you. As much as possible, 
                            I want to show you what I can offer to you as your boyfriend.
                            kahit walang pera now gagawa ng paraan para lang maging special lalong tong araw na to (tsaka mahal mga flowers and sweet gifts ngayon) 
                            HAHAHA I take every chance I have for us to feel that this love is real. Thank you for staying there with me through the ups and downs, and I hope this love of us will stay forever in our hearts. 
                            Falling in love with you is the easiest thing I've ever done; nothing matters to me but you, and every fucking single day that I'm alive, 
                            I'm aware of this. I loved you the day I met you, I love you today, and I will love you for the rest of my life. Happy Valentine's Day, My baby.
